## Overview

This took way loner than it was meant to.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## My process

I designed each component with styles and scripting individually becasue I was kind of confused by how everything was meant to be connected. I also designed with an initially smaller screen in mind.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I learned a lot about manipulating display grid and how columns and rows work. I also used a lot of onclick methods on the buttons in the html file and this helped me learn exactly how those work because I never understood them before. This project took longer than I would have liked. I frequently got lost in my styles and scripts, evne though I tried to be more organized. Because of this, its possible, there may be many redundant styles and lines of js code.
